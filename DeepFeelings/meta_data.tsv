0	i was a little sceptical buying this phone because some of the reviews said that the phone they received was locked or had slight damage however the one i received was perfect it came fully unlocked and  undamaged it looks as if i had baught it straight from apple so far an overall  stars and no complaints	0
1	this seller is amazing was a bit skeptical at first but this phone met my every expectation very trustworthy in every way no it doesn’t come with headphones at least it comes with a charger  a  day warranty i also got a brand new spanking battery i’ve checked the serial number online it is worthy	1
2	just was told by my carrier att that this phone is blacklisted the phone was blacklisted after  week of receiving the phone thanks amazon	3
3	i purchased this phone for my daughter and it came with no scratches or marks however it did not come with headphones	1
4	i don’t know why everyone’s giving this seller a bad review excellent phone and fast shipping  stars for me  i will be back to buy more soon	1
5	                    the media could not be loaded                 the phone clearly has some internal malfunction going on and this isn’t the performance i paid for definitely going to return this product for example i open an app the app automatically closes and there are things that appear on the screen every time the device is in power	0
6	received my iphone a few days ago and everything is working there’s a barely noticeable scratch on the screen but that is normal since it is refurbished i was hesitant to buy it due to the bad reviews but my phone is unlocked checked with apple and i love it my seller was  it’s a little bit more expensive but worth it	0
7	i absolutly loved this iphone xr it was wonderful	0
8	i’ll admit after reading through the reviews i was very hesitant but i am beyond happy with my purchasethe phone is flawless yes you read that right absolutely flawless it came with a glass screen protector already installed and all oem accessories phone has a brand new  capacity battery and is still under factory warranty until may  i understand some of this will vary but this is a review of my experiencei purchased another “renewed” phone pixel  from a different seller and it’s perfectly functional but no where near the condition this iphone xr arrived ini just popped my sim card in and it worked right away usually with my carrier i have to call in with the imei number but i didn’t have to i also tried a gsm sim card and it worked too fully unlocked as advertisedbest used phone purchase everso glad i did not listen to all the negative reviews	0
9	update  i still have this phone still works amazing battery lasts me all day even at  works like new  worth every penny update  my phone still works the same way it did when i got it even though i’ve dropped it and mishandled it a few times update  this phone still works perfectly i don’t carry my charger with me during the day anymore  is a perfect amount of storage this phone has frozen up less than  times since i got it screen still looks great i cracked it but it’s working and everything is still fast and accurate i’ve had no issues this is the best phone i’ve had in a while also the camera is amazing and i’ve come to fall in love with it i’ve attached a picture i took with the phone belowmy phone is amazing obviously i’d show it if i wasn’t on it right now i waited a few days before making this review so i could make sure no quirks popped upfirst of all this is the best battery life i’ve ever had on a phone ever i went out for  hours and came home and my phone was on  at the end of the day same thing with school my phone was at about  at the end of the school day now it charges pretty slowly in my opinion but the slow charging is definitely worth the batterysize wise the phone is pretty big it is a handful to hold and hard to throw in my pocket the screen size is beautiful for watching videos and doing digital stuff but the phone is just a little bigthe software works perfectly the touch is fine face id is incredibly fast and accurate and it opens apps very fast it also responds really well to my touch my last phone did notthe speaker is amazing it’s so loud that i didn’t even need my speaker in the shower the phone was loud enough by itself i took a call in a room full of noisy kids and my dad said he couldn’t even really hear them so they cancel noise microphone is good i can say “hey siri” quietly and it’ll activateoverall i’m really impressed i was very nervous looking at other reviews but my phone is working so perfectly right now i am definitely satisfied especially with paying  less than apple was chargingthen again i upgraded from a cracked  so that could be the reason i’m so over the moon haha	0
10	i purchased this red xr about  weeks ago i finally decided to activate it i open the box theres no earbuds inside as well as the sim card tray was missing	0
11	back was cracked in several places screen severely scratched phone locked so unable to immediately see if it works spent over  would not recommend	3
12	it took a little while for it to arrive but other than that it is a great phone nice pictures its pretty heavy though but iphones are not for me im going back to samsung	0
13	please do not buy this phone they say that the phone is unlocked but it is not and the only way to get it unlocked is to go to the original carrier however it is impossible to find out who the carrier was i bought  different sim cards none of them worked talked to so many different carriers to resolve the issue and nothing was resolved i sent the phone back got my refund and purchase a phone directly from apple i wish i could get all my time and energy back i used to try and get this phone to work disappointed	3
14	i love how it was super intact on the outside but i paid for  it had like  and it kept turning off randomly and the battery percentage was going up and down	1
15	pésimo el teléfono vino bloqueado con clave y con fotos de la persona anterior dentro del mismo	2
16	worlds worst thing ever never get on this its a scam	1
17	phone looks literally brand new no cracks work fine and the battery is  like i just brought it from a store  recommended this phone	1
18	described as “fully unlocked” received it in excellent condition except after hours on the phone with my carrieramazon and apple it turns out the thing was locked  no thanks returned and buying a new one from apple directly	0
19	just what i needed for my teenager she wanted a newer iphone  almost  which no way in h i was going to spend that moneyso i looked on amazon and came across this iphone xr read the reviews thought about it for a little and decided to give it a try the one part that convinced me was the price and most importantly that the purchase was backed up with amazon purchase and returns so received it yesterday fully unlocked no scratches or dents screen was in perfect shape came with the charger and it was just like any brand new purchased phonei had a previous sim card called metro by tmobile and transferred altransferredl the info to the new iphone and vuala i gad a fully working iphone for less than  my goal and didn’t even needed to go to the store to activateso overall on my personal opinion with no benefits or paying me for review this was a great purchase	0
20	 i bought two phones for my two sons this weekend one works just fine one immediately started spazzing and glitching and putting up multiple screens at a time it’s impossible to use i’ve been on the phone all day with apple customer service and now they say i have to take it to the apple store to verify it’s not working i’m very frustrated i just want each phone i bought to be useable and not have to drive all over creation the day before thanksgiving	0
21	this phone is actually not fully unlocked	3
22	phone is not unlocked to carriers and when you try to add it to any service provider they will say the imei number is invalid meaning it’s not a real device i made the seller aware of the issue and was ensured i would be refunded i placed the phone in a plain box and secured the phone with foam after reaching out multiple times i get a message saying “unfortunately the time is damaged and we can’t refund you because we don’t cover physical damage” i made them aware that the item wasn’t damaged when i shipped it the whole issue is this phone has a false imei  and cannot connect to carriers so it’s basically a brick all they keep saying is they can’t do anything i’m pretty sure the phone was intentionally cracked so that they could continue with there scam and not refund me i didn’t even ask for an actual refund i just wanted the phone unlocked the way it is advertised so now i’m out of  with a brick that’s now magically cracked please be careful	3
23	this refurbished phone is awesome i got mine from chubbiestech out of ny and it was perfect i had almost no trouble switching my service with metropcs from my  to the xr it came on time and looks great the battery capacity is  and besides one little dent that i only saw because i looked for it you wouldnt even be able to tell that the phone wasnt brand new hopefully phone stays good but as of now i couldnt have hoped for a better experience with the phone  seller fedex on the other hand thats a different storyedit this phone while it connected to my carrier will not stay connected to service it will say im connected but none of the cellular features or data features will work ive done everything that has been recommended to me download apn reset network settings get a new sim card and nothing has fixed the problem as soon as i actually get a response from the seller i plan to exchange itedit  the seller i got my phone from chubbiestech was super helpful and setme up with a new phone no problem the second phone worked perfectly and im very happy with my purchase forgot to update before but id definitely say that this is a good way to get a new phone for cheaper	3
24	the iphone xr came in quickly and in great condition i honestly couldnt even tell it was refurbished we have not had any issues as of today and have been using the phone for  days i would definitely recommend this product	0
25	the phone didnt come in an apple box but the box that it came in was very secure it came with a charger and a sim card tool i have verizon i was able to take the sim out of my old iphone and put it in my new iphone that simple no calls needed to verizon there was not a single scratch on this phone it was as it it wasnt even used the battery life lasts me about  days but im a pretty heavy user there are no issues with sound the ports or wifi such a great deal for such a great phone	0
26	i love the phonexr had it for  weeks and it works perfect i didn’t get headphones with it but being refurbished it didn’t come with the “usual” stuff i am so happy with the price and functionality of this phone i contacted the sellers about something the day i got the phone and they replied the next morning and helped me with all my questions i am more then pleased	0
27	after spending a day setting up my new iphone xr i finally got it ready to activate and use for a call my daughter called me and i could barely hear her the sound was so muffled and low in volume when i put her on the speaker the sound was fine i tried several more calls to see if it was possibly her phone or even our cell coverage that was causing this issue with the same resultswhen i ordered this phone i understood that amazon or the seller would have actually made sure that the phone was usable it is not i cleaned it and tried multiple fixes suggested online to no avail i took it to apple to see if they could fix it with software or cleaning and they showed me a glimpse of this specific phones previous trips to the apple store to resolve sound issues  there were several with notes showing that poor sound quality was an issue shame on the seller and amazon for taking advantage of customers by selling them junk	0
28	i specifically bought from this seller because their reviews and ratings were better than the othersunfortunately my phone did not work with verizon as stated  the first time they tried to register it it came up as being an orange phone  this one is white  then when they put in sim card it would not register at all  i could use if i connected to wifi only	3
29	i got mine last sunday and it’s amazing so far when i got it it had no scratches dents or anything it’s a great phone the battery life lasts for like ever it even said it was in good condition but it’s in fabulous condition i would recommend gooverstock seller to anyone a very happy it even has a warranty till march  	1
30	so my wife was in the market for a new iphone upgrading from her iphone  which was now obsolete according to several required apps she uses for work i couldnt bring myself to pay apple  dollars or more for a new basic phone i tried to get my wife to agree to an android and that wasnt going to happen then i found these amazon renewed phones i wound up saving about  dollars on an almost new iphone xrthe phone was delivered when it said it would be delivered and does appear as new as possible less the original packaging and equipment the box was a repackage box the power adapter was an unknown usb wall charger and the cable was a lightning cable although it had a crack in the lightning plug housing so it will last about a weekthe migration from old phone to new phone took about an hour with an ios upgrade in for good measure this phone came with  and  has been out for only a few weeks so it is close to currentoverall happy about the phone time will tell if i run into issues with it lasting but so far all is good	0
31	i bought  of these iphone xrs  my sons was great he had it up and running in just a few minutesi didnt have the same luck  first the unit was scratched i had never purchased anything renewed so that was a surprise to me  it also had a sizeable crackdent on the lower right corner which was also a shock  but i figured that is just how refurbished phones looked the camera looked pristineand that is why i wanted a newer iphone model so i was okay with itthe trouble started when i was setting up the phone this sucker started getting hot  i thought it was because it was being activated or something again i have never purchased a refurbished phone so i had no idea  then after set up i was done using it  i sat it on my nightstand and didnt think about it againwhen my daughter called me later that afternoon i picked up the phone and it was hottttttttttttt  i mean iron your clothes hot  i asked my son if he was experiencing the same thing and he was not i asked my daughter if any of her iphone had ever burned her hand her answer was no as well so i had to return the phoneas something much be wrong with iti went to print out my return label and noticed the seller has written that all returned phones with incur a  restocking feeso youre telling me you can sell me a damaged phone and get  bucks profitso there is no incentive to ever care about sending out good productsthat could be a second stream of business all to itself sell a damaged phone get money on the return rinse and repeat  i will be fighting this tooth and nail  this is outrageous	0
32	la verdad tenia muchas dudas compre este celular para ecuador pero ya llevo una semana y parece completamente nuevo  bateria al    funciona a la perfeccion	2
33	despite all the reviews saying that this device is fully unlocked and compatible with any phone carrier it is wrong it is not compatible with verizon so dont let them scheme you as they did me	3
34	it arrived on time i bought for my son it has great battery life good as new no complaints here	1
35	i am wanting a full refund this phone is stolen i just went through amazon and tried to request a return  i  am currently waiting for the seller to respond the phone did not come with a charger nor a manual upon inquiring about that they emailed me a copy of a manual did not address the issue about the charger ive spent nearly my entire day  at an att corporate store the phone came in what looked to be great aesthetic condition in a clear bag inside a regular cardboard boxno original packaging at all i went to att to have the phone activated after trying repeatedly to activate the phone over a time frame of  hours they proceeded to ask me where i purchased the phone from i advised them and showed them the receipt information they advised me that they were trying to activate the phone but kept running into multiple error issues with the sim and phone id they input new sims etc the representative got the phone to activate for a minimum of about  minutes total after activating the rep tried to make a call to verify that the phone operated and the phone dial tone gave an error message of  blocked from network use the att representative and a manager messed with it multiple times and could not get it to work the supervisor at that point advised us that att along with all the other cellular companies monitor sim cards and phone ids for stolen or lost traffic this phone was apparently reported stolen according to the phone id she stated they would not activate it refused to give the phone back to me until i called the cops and filled out a report ive contacted the seller with a message requesting them to give me my money back asap as i want to send this stolen phone back to them i want nothing to do with it a police report has been filed	3
36	in near perfect condition almost no sign of use the boxing was a little generic and not so great in terms of unboxing flavor but that’s the only gripe i have no problems and its miiiiiiineedit the phone stopped receiving cell service in a week make sure to get a return or replacement from the networkstore as networkstore doesnt respect manufacturer repairs	1
37	don’t buy this phone i bought a beautiful blue color it worked perfectly for two months then it got blocked by tmobile i contacted tmobile and guess what they tel me this phone was previously owned by a guy who didn’t pay off the full price now i’m stuck with a blocked imei phone and nono one can do anything about it tried to return it and the seller won’t accept my return currently working on starting an az return request via amazon such a disgrace	3
38	el teléfono parece en buen estado pero no traía auriculares y el cargador que recibí no sirve la verdad no aconcejo comprar a este vendedor	2
39	bought for my son and he loves it	1
40	this is my first phone purchase in almost a decade i am going from an iphone  to an iphone xri asked someone for advice for where to purchase my next iphone i have a lack of trust when it comes to purchasing phones on the internet after hearing about so many stories of people being scammed i was told by a couple of people that amazon has registered users so i gave it a tryso far i am happy with my purchase the iphone is in like new condition with no major scratches however there are two little scratch indentations on the front screen they are hardly noticeable because they are to the side of the front just off the lcd screen and screen protector and do not interfere with the use of the phonewhen it comes to the actual phone itself the big screen sound quality and fast processor are something to smile about apple outdid themselves with this phone the only thing that will take some getting use to is the big slim design i find it hard to reach some parts of the screen while holding the phone in one hand i think there is an adjustment period the phone was incredibly easy to setup i just had to back my old iphone up to itunes and then restore that backup on the xri do not like how there is no headphone jack and that the phone only has  storage but this can be overlooked i know that i also have the option of purchasing a different model that has better storage and a headphone jack i just thought it is worth mentioning for anyone considering to buy this itemprosgreat price fast shipping time sold from someone trustworthy honest listing and as described came with screen protector and sim removal tool the phone indicates that the battery life is at  a phone great quality overall the lcd screen is big and bright the sound is fantastic the processor is super fast i think one of the fastest processors you can purchase in a smartphoneconsthe phone came with a knockoff charger not an oem original apple charger or headphones yes using an apple charger versus using a knock off makes a difference look into it if you do not believe me fortunately i have my old apple chargers the screen has a couple miner indented scratches my finger covers the mic at the bottom of the phone sometimes when i record videos the audio gets blocked or becomes scratchyi made this review as detailed as possible because i greatly benefited from other reviews made by other people that purchased this phoneone major takeaway from all of the comments on this listing is to be careful that you may or may not get a phone that has some sort of issue i think this comes with the territory when it comes to purchasing a renewed phone when you are spending a lot of money on a phone you expect quality and consistency for a couple of hundred dollars more i could have bought straight from apple but i am happy i got to save that money	0
41	honestly blown away beautiful condition not one single scratch or dent fully unlocked took it right to metro and hooked it up signature was required for delivery which i appreciate i got the coral  for my daughter for her birthdayit was great deal phone comes w charger but no headphones which i knew alreadyi am so impressed i want to buy another from this seller for myself it was chubbiestech for anyone looking i will continue to buy from this particular seller when i have the option i’ve saw many horror stories buying refurbished phones but i’m telling you this was looked brand new	0
42	i figured with the description of such slight defects that may be acceptable by amazon for a refurbished iphone xr it would be worth it to save  by ordering a refurbished for  rather than order a brand new one from apple for  i first opened the box updated the phone and got it set up with my apps everything was great then i went to the apple store to buy a screen protector and some other accessories when i was putting on the screen protector i noticed a crack which runs almost the entire length of the screen it appears the seller buffed this and possibly used a glass filler to hide the cracked screen i’ve taken photos to sharei ordered this phone as i’m traveling and needed a new phone well i have no choice but to eat this scam by amazon and the seller because i’m traveling and don’t have an option to not use this phoneamazon should require high quality photos of actual products on sale not images copied from apples marketing of a product	0
43	this was a gift for my sisters birthday worked like a charm the only set back was having to catch up the phone on all of the updates but that was resolved and the set up was overall easy to do and manageable i would definitely buy an amazon renewed product in the future if amazon is putting their stamp of approval on these types of items i as the consumer am trusting this company to make sure what i am getting is up to par with the standards i hold this company that ive been using for years iphones are not the cheapest phones by a landslide so i expect these bricks to work well even if they are partially used great condition overall without any scratches almost new if anything else and arrived in packaging protecting the device	0
44	the phone is perfect just wish it came with a good charger come on it came with a android charger with with a iphone tip adapter wow	0
45	                    the media could not be loaded                 i bought two phones both came with  battery yay  one of them was in perfect cosmetic condition while the other not so much the block one came with a deep scratch on the back of the phone which is very visiblenot visible based on the lighting it also had small scratches on the corners of the phone i guess if you get a case and cover it up it doesnt really matter but i am just slightly disappointed with the inconsistency between the two phones i got if you are hesitating about buying this just keep in mind that you are taking a gamble with the cosmetic condition but the phone itself is great i bought if from chubbiestech btw	0
46	i was very hesitant to buy this product but i took the risk because it was an amazon product the cell phone took  extra day for delivery it was brand new or at least it looked like the phone was perfect clean imei and unlocked but apparently it was a verizon phone which is not compatible with tmobile network i called the seller multiple times and did not replied to maybe change the product for one that worked for me but no luck i submitted a request to returned it and they immediately replied and make things smooth	3
47	this is a beautiful iphone however i had some issues with mine periodically it would freeze up and i even had problems with the rotation at one point it took  minutes till i was able to get it upright i even had a few texts messages ithat it wasn’t delivered but i read some great reviews before i purchased it and i would agree that this phone is a great value and if i haven’t mentioned it’s absolutely gorgeous i would absolutely recommend this phone and the seller they reached out to me right away because of my issues is the only reason i give this review a  stars i would recommend that if you purchase this phone make sure that you purchase a case and a screen protector because you don’t want to lose your investment it’s just that beautiful i truly love this phone and i’m sure you will too you can buy everything on amazon so go for it and don’t hesitate	0
48	the phone came with no box and no headset and no instructions just the phone in bubble wrap but still works ok	0
49	i love how a good price i got this phone for its just has a little scratch but thats what happens when you get refurbished items but im complaining about the battery life i charged it to  and i only used it for  mins i thought i had a good buy but to check the battery percentage it dropped significantly at first i thought i was tripping it came to me at  percent and it died fast so i let it charge to  and as you can see the picture it dies fast i needed a replacement because my oldnphone broke just be careful if any of you guys going to buy it and this happens i never complained about anything or reviewed stuff but just be sure to look out for little things like that i contacted the seller im just waiting to see what he or she to respond	1
